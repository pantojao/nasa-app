Nasa Image Generator

The application uses React and Fetch to displayimages from NASA's Astronomy Picutre of the Day API and their Image Library API. This is also one of the first full projects where I implemented react router.

The application has two major features. First is the random image generator that utilized the APOD API. The feature allows you to generate a new image and learn more about each individual image with the buttons located at the bottom. You can also have the images display in high definition. This will increase the load time for some images.

The second feature allows the user explore the NASA image library. The client will return a grid of cards with the images that match the search query. These cards are clickable and allow the user to learn more about the image.

Technologies: React, React Router, Fetch, CSS (Grid), HTML
